# Deep Learning Capstone Project Report
## Definition
### Project Overview
While computers can easily digest and process text input like the sentence you're reading right now, the task of recognizing text that is depicted by an image has [historically](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_optical_character_recognition) been much more difficult.

Early attempts relied on [heavily](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OCR-A)-[standardized](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OCR-B) fonts, responsible in large part for the iconic blocky numbers at the bottom of checks (7 below).

Understandably, this is not an ideal solution, since we would like to be able to feed a computer the exact same input that we ourselves receive.  
For example, ideally a computer would be able to tell us that the following image represents "31"

**Digit recognition** is a subset of text recognition (a 10-character subset, to be exact), and is the focus of this project.

### Problem Statement
This project seeks to identify and output numbers which are contained in images.
