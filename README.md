This project uses data from the [MNIST](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) and [SVHN](http://ufldl.stanford.edu/housenumbers/) datasets.

This project was completed for the [Udacity Machine Learning Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/machine-learning-engineer-nanodegree-by-google--nd009).

If you're in that nanodegree or a related course right now, obey all honor code requirements before viewing this code.  
I recommend that this code should only be viewed _after_ you've completed your own implementation.  
If you're super stuck, take a break, take a walk, and it will come to you; good luck.
